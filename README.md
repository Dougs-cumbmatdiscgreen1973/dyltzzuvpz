Bro, just finished watching the G20 thing and, like, where do I even start? ðŸ˜‚ These world leaders act like they're in this high school clique, you know what I mean? One second they're all formal and diplomatic, but then you catch these snarky side-eye moments. Like, come on, we see you! ðŸ¤¨ 

Anyway, I mean, I get it, politics is messy, but seriously, could they not act a little less, I dunno, dramatic? Kinda felt like a political soap opera. Where's the popcorn when you need it? I was watching and halfway through, remembered I still gotta download the movie we talked about last week. Total brain fart moment right there. 

> Macron was all like, We must work together, but you could see he's side-eyeing Trudeau, and I'm just there thinking, Dude, save it for the group chat. ðŸ˜‚ And then someone brought up climate change, and I'm like, Hey, dude, haven't we been here before? How do they even keep a straight face with this stuff, man?

And lol, Biden was like a dad at a BBQ trying to keep everyone chill while they stand in their little circles. Do you think they arranged those standing positions based on who likes who? I swear, it was like, Okay, you stand next to him, and maybe don't sit Juha across from Narendra, okay? Absolute madness.

But yeah, somewhere in the back of my head, I kept thinking, Man, can't wait to watch the movie tonight. All this international drama is enough for one day, ya know?

Anyway, so I'm kinda tired but equally hyped, and I don't even know why. Need to sleep soon, but my brain's all over the place. Let's catch up later and see if they end up doing something cool or just the same old dance. Peace out! ðŸ¤™
